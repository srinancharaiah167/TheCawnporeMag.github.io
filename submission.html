                <p class="intro">We understand that following submission guidelines can be crucial and sometimes challenging. Your attention to these guidelines will greatly assist us in reviewing your work effectively and maintaining the quality of our publication.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. We kindly ask that you refrain from submitting works that have been previously published or are being simultaneously considered elsewhere.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. We love original content, so please ensure that your submission is created by you and not generated by AI. If you're submitting a multilingual piece, we'd also appreciate a translation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. When you submit, please include your name and the genre of your piece in the subject line. In the body of the email, a third-person bio would be fantastic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. We prefer documents to be in .docx or pdf format.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5. If your work is accepted, we may make some edits. Don't worry, we'll send the edited version to you for review before it's published. If there are any changes you aren't comfortable with, or if you'd like to make additional edits, just let us know.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    6. For fiction pieces, send them to thecawnporefiction@gmail.com.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    7. For non-fiction, send them to nonfictionthecawnpore@gmail.com.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    8. For poetry pieces, send them to poetrythecawnpore@gmail.com.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    10. If you have anything else you'd like to submit, such as a book or movie review, just send it to thecawnporemagofficial@gmail.com.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    11.
