                 Thank you to everyone who shared their work with us!

                <br>
<!--                 We understand that following submission guidelines can be crucial and sometimes challenging. Your attention to these guidelines will greatly assist us in reviewing your work effectively and maintaining the quality of our publication.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. We kindly ask that you refrain from submitting works that have been previously published or are being simultaneously considered elsewhere.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. We love original content, so please ensure that your submission is created by you and not generated by AI. If you're submitting a multilingual piece, we'd also appreciate a translation in English.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. When you submit, please include your name and the genre of your piece in the subject line. In the body of the email, a third-person bio would be fantastic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. For poetry and prose, submit your work in .doc, .docx, or .pdf format. Use Times New Roman, 12 pt font. No line count for poetry; word limit for fiction and non-fiction is 2500 words.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5. Art & photography must be sent as high-resolution JPG or PNG files.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    6. If your work is accepted, we may make some edits. Don't worry, we'll send the edited version to you for review before it's published. If there are any changes you aren't comfortable with, or if you'd like to make additional edits, just let us know.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    7. For fiction pieces, send them to thecawnporefiction@gmail.com.
